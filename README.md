Fogo.sh RFCs

The "RFC" (request for cuddles) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new projects, and changes to existing projects, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction of fogo.sh.

This repository very much steals aspects of, and is based on the [rust-lang/rfcs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) repository.
